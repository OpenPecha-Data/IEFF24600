The "Heart of Perfect Wisdom", Short Form
Homage to the Perfection of Wisdom, the Lovely, the Holy!
----------
Avalokita, the Holy Lord and Bodhisattva, was moving in the deep course of the Wisdom which has gone beyond. I. He looked down from on high, He beheld but five heaps, and He saw that in their own-being they were empty.

II. Here, O Sariputra,II,1 form is emptiness and the very emptiness is form ; II,2 emptiness does not differ from form, form does not differ from emptiness, II,3 whatever is form, that is emptiness, whatever is emptiness, that is form,
II,4 the same is true of feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness.
III. Here, O Śāriputra, III,1 all dharmas are marked with emptiness; III,2a they are neither produced nor stopped, III,2b neither defiled nor immaculate, III,2c neither deficient nor complete.IV Therefore, O Śāriputra, where there is emptiness IV,1 there is neither form, nor feeling, nor perception, nor impulse, nor consciousness,IV,2 no eye, or ear, or nose, or tongue, or body, or mind,IV,3 no form, nor sound, nor smell, nor taste, nor touchable nor object of mind,IV,4 no sight organ element, etc. until we come to, no mind-consciousness element;
IV,5 there is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, etc. until we come to, there is no decay and death, no extinction of decay and death; IV,6 there is no suffering, nor origination, nor stopping, nor path; IV,7 there is no cognition, IV,1 no attainment and no non-attainment.
V,1a Therefore, O Śāriputra, owing to a Bodhisattva's indifference to any kind of personal attainment, V,1b and through his having relied on the perfection of wisdom, V,1c he dwells without thought-coverings.V,2a In the absence of thought-coverings he has not been made to tremble, V,2b he has overcome what can upset, V,2c in the end sustained by Nirvana.VI All those Buddhas who appear in the three periods of time, through having relied on the perfection of wisdom they fully awake to the utmost, right and perfect Enlightenment.
VII,1 Therefore one should know the Prajñāpāramitā VII,2 as the great spell, the spell of great knowledge, the utmost spell, the unequalled spell, allayer of all suffering, in truth – for what could go wrong?By the prajnaparamita has this spell been delivered.VII,3 It runs like this: GONE, GONE, GONE BEYOND, GONE ALTOGETHER BEYOND, O WHAT AN AWAKENING, ALL HAIL!
This completes the Heart of perfect Wisdom.
